# Milestone Project 1 

Brefi: A am to create a static website using front end developer tools such as HTML and CSS to create a user friendly web application as to showcase my ability with these tools and understanding of user centric design. Whilst also accommodating for a range of interface(s) and devices for accessibility and usability.   

I hope to use this document to record my progression and reasoning behind certain techniques and decisions for clarity and future expansion of existing functions. 

Clientele: Project idea 0

“Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as a guide to the minimum required functionality”. 

I have decided to use the first example given: Build a website for a band (real or fictional).
As in my free time I make music,  do graphics design and make digital art I will be able to use these materials as the actual content of the website. I will go about creating a fake band using my work as to showcase my ability to meet a clients expectations within the specification of the assessments criteria and the scenario provided. 

The clientele would like me to create a website that would fit within the style of the band itself as to not look contrasting to their work, most importantly they want the websites finished product to look professional. 

So this means I need to create website that has the functionality of:

1. images, links to his music and videos
2. Display gig dates and link social media 
3. Linking merchandising/Music for purchase
4. Give information regarding contacting the band for fan mail or possible gigs

 
## UX

Case Study: Band websites. 

Before designing the layout and full functionality of the band website, I have decided to do a short case study on a few of my favourite artists and bands as to get an idea of the functionality and overall look of the website. 

CASE 1: LCD SOUNDSYSTEM
This is the LCD sound-system website, the more or less defunct band has not put any content on their page for quite some time. Although all of the features my client wishes to have are present on this website: Merchandising, Tour dates/Gigs, Links to social media and links to various streaming services.  

CASE 2: Mac DeMarco

This is Mac DeMarco’s website, this site is currently active. Notably this website is quite simple, making it easy to use. Allowing the external user to get the information they are looking for as to serve the websites owner in selling more merchandise and getting fans/new fans interested in macs outfit. 

CASE 3: Radiohead
Radioheads website has similar features to the previous websites, The “busiest” of the three.

These websites helped inspire the finished product.
